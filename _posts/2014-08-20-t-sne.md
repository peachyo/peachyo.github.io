While stuck at Puerto Rico airport due to some unexpected object in the runway, I started reading the blog of the presenter for tomorrow's machine learning meetup. Here is the [link](http://benanne.github.io/2014/08/05/spotify-cnns.html). The work is on recommending music with deep learning. t-SNE is used for data visualization. I have always wanted to do something with this algorithm. Last time at the ML meetup, Jeroen Janseens talked about using t-SNE for one-class classification. It was quite interesting. t-SNE is a computation intensive algorithm, It will be nice if I can get my hands on a GPU machine. :)
