Here is a talk I did for the recent Java Webinar Series at my company. The presentation is made with reveal.js. Works best with Chrome. The keyboard options don't work in IE and the D3.js zoom event seems to interfere with reveal.js events. 

In this paper "[Informed Options Trading prior to M&A Announcements:Insider Trading?](http://irrcinstitute.org/pdf/Informed-Options-Trading_June-12-2014.pdf)", the authors investigated informed trading activity in equity options prior to the announcement of corporate mergers and acquisitions (M&A).
